## **Abstract**
This experiment demonstrates text-to-image generation using the **Stable Diffusion v1.5** model from RunwayML. By providing the text prompt **"moon"**, the model leverages deep learning techniques to produce a realistic and artistic image representing the concept of the moon. The process uses the **Diffusers** library with **PyTorch**, allowing execution on either GPU or CPU. The generated image is displayed and saved locally as `generated_image.png`.
